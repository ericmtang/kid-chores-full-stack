README

This project was created as practice working with the MERN stack (using React Native) for my NuCamp coding bootcamp Full Stack course series. I wanted to have the project to have a practical application. Keeping track of my child's behavior / consquences was hard to do day in and day out, so I decided to create an app to do this. 

Technologies / Modules used:
- React Native 
- Node
- Express 
- Mongo / Mongoose
- Redux (with Persist)
- Websockets (Socket.io)
- RESTful Web Services

Possible Future Enhancements:
- More graphics / icons
- Ability to switch between multiple children
- Add a cloud/hosted back end
- Ability to move from day to day / have daily history
