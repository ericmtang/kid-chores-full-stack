README

This project was created as practice working with React Native and Redux for my NuCamp coding bootcamp Front End course series. I wanted to have the project to have a practical application. Keeping track of my child's behavior / consquences was hard to do day in and day out, so I decided to create an app to do this. 

Technologies / Modules used:
- React Native and Redux (with Persist)

Possible Future Enhancements:
- More graphics / icons
- Ability to switch between multiple children
- Add a cloud/hosted back end
- Ability to move from day to day / have daily history
